## Simple Linear Regression in Python ðŸ“ˆ
This script demonstrates how to run a simple linear regression using Python. Here's a brief overview:

## What is Linear Regression? ðŸ¤”
Linear regression is a way to understand the relationship between two things. For example, we might want to know how the amount of study time affects test scores. In simple linear regression, we use a straight line to predict one thing based on another.

## What Are We Doing?
In this example, we'll create a list of 10 numbers for x and 10 numbers for y. We'll then use these numbers to find the best straight line that fits our data. After that, we'll plot the data and the line to see how well the line fits.

## How to Run This Code:
Clone this repo! Or just copy the code into a Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook or a Python script) and run it. It will show you a plot with our data and the best-fit line.
